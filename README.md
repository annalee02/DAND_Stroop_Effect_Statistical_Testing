## Project Overview
In this project, I investigated a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. I learned a little bit about the experiment, created a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then went through the task by myself. Then I looked at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and computed some statistics describing the results. Finally, I interpreted my results in terms of my hypotheses.

## Why this Project?
Statistics is a major component of data analysis, it allows me to investigate data and make inferences based on my observations. A foundation in statistics also allows me to be a consumer of analyses that others perform and to relate to the conclusions others have drawn from their investigations.

## What did I Learn?
This project reviews the basic concepts of statistics, including:

* How to identify components of an experiment
* How to use descriptive statistics to describe qualities of a sample
* How to set up a hypothesis test, make inferences from a sample, and draw conclusions based on the results

## Why is this Important to my Career?
This project is focused on statistics, including designing an experiment and testing a hypothesis. Using statistics to draw valid conclusions about data is an important part of a data analyst's work.
